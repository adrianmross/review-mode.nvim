# Changelog

## v0.2.0 - 2026-06-01

### Changed

- Improve PR review startup performance by loading PR metadata and changed-file
  status asynchronously.
- Load hunk locations lazily per file instead of parsing the entire PR patch
  during `PrReviewStart`.
- Keep the built-in old-version diff backend while making base-file loading
  asynchronous and applying a temporary fast `diffopt` for the split.
- Cache changed-file indexes and `nvim-tree` decorator relpaths to reduce repeat
  work during navigation and tree rendering.

### Benchmarks

- On a generated PR fixture with 1,000 changed files and 80 lines per file,
  `PrReviewStart` returned in 11 ms, down from 311 ms on `v0.1.0`, and the
  changed-file map was ready in 42 ms, down from 311 ms.
- On a generated PR fixture with 3,000 changed files and 80 lines per file,
  `PrReviewStart` returned in 10 ms, down from 756 ms on `v0.1.0`, and the
  changed-file map was ready in 40 ms, down from 756 ms.
- First hunk navigation now pays the lazy hunk-load cost, about 15-18 ms in the
  generated benchmark, instead of front-loading all hunk parsing during
  `PrReviewStart`.

### Added

- Add a `devenv` shell with Neovim, GitHub CLI, Git, and Stylua.
- Add repeatable validation and benchmark scripts for generated PR fixtures.
